        | ohmage is a platform built for participatory sensing (users contributing data to projects
        | that benefit themselves, their community, or research). It handles the collection of data,
        | management of users, and the visualization of the collected data. If you'd like to participate
        | in an existing study, visit the 
        a(href="#collect") collect 
        | area below.  If you're a researcher, professor or other coordinator who would like to create
        | your own data project, you may want to read a bit further to

        | ohmage is an open source platform with server, mobile and web components.  Whether 
        | you're a seasoned java or javascript developer or a newcomer, we'd love to have you 
        | improve our platform!

        | If you're looking to self host an ohmage server, look no further! While our partners 
        | on the Mobilize project have been nice enough to offer a free sandbox server for use, 
        | if you project plans are lofty or you'd just like the stability of hosting ohmage on 
        | your own you can get it up and running in minutes on a linux server in your datacenter 
        | or in the cloud! Learn more...
      p
        | ohmage needs only java, tomcat and mysql to work! We've done the majority of our testing/support 
        | on Ubuntu LTS releases (12.04 and 14.04) though, so you may want to start there.  If you'd like 
        | the 'express' version, we support a chef cookbook for ohmage on the supermarket! If you're really 
        | ready to go it alone, check out the quickstart steps below:
      ol
        li install java, tomcat and mysql
        li download/compile the ohmage server project
        li copy the resulting war file to tomcat's webapp directory
        li run the db prep scripts from the `db` directory in the ohmage server source
        li create a simple /etc/ohmage.conf file with this db information
        li restart tomcat
      p
        | Now, it's likely you'll want to add some/all of the frontend clients you've seen on display above.  
        | Take a look at the projects to see if they need to be compiled and start serving the static pages 
        | with your favorite web server (we really like nginx, for obvious reasons)! Note that these projects 
        | may expect ohmage to be running at /app.
